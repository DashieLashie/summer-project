# Adapting Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning Tools to an end-to-end Day Trading System.


## Abstract
Stock prediction has been extensively studied, and researchers and investors continually leverage state-of-the-art techniques to gain a competitive edge. Day trading remains especially challenging due to market volatility and the noise that must be filtered to extract predictive signals for trading decisions.
This project develops an end-to-end system combining deep learning and natural language processing techniques with a robust staking and risk management strategy.
Experiments, including evaluations and investment simulations, showed that significant feature engineering would be required to integrate tweet-derived market data with stock technical indicators. Moreover, since tweet data were not available for every trading day, models using only technical indicators consistently outperformed those including tweet features.
Nevertheless, the end-to-end system achieved returns of 1.61\% over one hundred trading days, providing a foundation for further development into a competitive day trading approach.
